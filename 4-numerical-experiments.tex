We demonstrate the phase-transition phenomena with numerical experiments.

\subsection{The strong classification boundary in finite dimensions}

The sparsity and signal size of the sparse mean vector are parametrized as in \eqref{eq:signal-sparsity} and \eqref{eq:signal-size}, and signal sizes are assumed  equal.
We estimate the support set $S$ with using Bonferroni's procedure, where the nominal FWER level for Bonferroni's procedures are set at $1/(5{\log{p}})$, in line with the assumptions in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squred-strong-boundary}.
Experiments were repeated 1000 times at each of the 400 sparsity-and-signal-size combinations, and for dimensions 100, 1000, and 10000.

The empirical probabilities of exact support recovery under Bonferroni's procedure are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared}.
The numerical results suggest that the predicted boundaries are reasonably accurate in high-dimensions ($p=10000$, right panels of Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared}), and relevant even at moderate dimensions ($p=100$, left panels of Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared}).

We conduct further experiments to examine the optimality claims in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squred-strong-boundary} by applying the oracle procedure with thresholds $t_p=\min_{i\in S}x(i)$.
We also examine the claims Remark \ref{rmk:strong-classification-boundary-1}, and compare the one-sided alternatives in Gaussian additive models with the two-sided alternatives (or equivalently, the chi-square model).
We apply both Bonferroni's procedure and the oracle procedure in both settings.

Experiments were repeated 1000 times for signal sizes ranging from $r=0$ to $6$, and for dimensions 100, 1000, and 10000.
Results of the experiments, shown in Figure \ref{fig:one-vs-two-sided-exact_support_recovery}, suggest vanishing difference between difficulties of two-sided vs one-sided alternatives in the additive error models, as well as vanishing difference between the powers of Bonferroni's procedures and the oracle procedures.

\subsection{The weak classification boundary in finite dimensions}

Similar experiments are conducted to examine the optimality claims in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squred-weak-boundary}, and in Remark \ref{rmk:weak-classification-boundary}.
The oracle thresholding procedure for approximate support recovery is defined to be the thresholding procedure with threshold
$$
t_p \in \argmin_{t} \frac{|\widehat{S}(t)\setminus S|}{\max\{|\widehat{S}(t)|,1\}} + \frac{|S\setminus \widehat{S}(t)|}{\max\{|{S}|,1\}},
%\mathcal{R^\mathrm{oracle}} \in \argmin_{\widehat{S}(\mathcal{R})\in\mathcal{S}} \mathrm{risk}^{\mathrm{A}}(\mathcal{R}),
$$
where $\widehat{S}(t) = \{i\;|\;x(i)\ge t\}$;
in implementation, we need only scan the observations $t\in\{x(1), \ldots, x(;p)\}$. 
The nominal FDR levels are set at $1/(5{\log{p}})$, in line with the assumptions in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squred-weak-boundary}; all other parameters are identical to that in the experiments for exact support recovery.
Results of the experiments are shown in Figure \ref{fig:one-vs-two-sided-approx_support_recovery} and Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared-weak-boundary}.
