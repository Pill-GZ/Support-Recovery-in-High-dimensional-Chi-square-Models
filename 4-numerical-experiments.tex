We illustrate the phase-transition phenomena in finite dimensions with numerical experiments.
% We also demonstrate the fundamental trade-off between odds ratios and relative frequencies in association studies, as outlined in Proposition \ref{prop:signal-size-odds-ratio} and Corollary \ref{cor:signal-size-odds-ratio-conditional-frequency}, using evidence from large-scale genetic studies.

\subsection{The exact support recovery problem}

The sparsity and signal size of the sparse mean vector in the experiments are parametrized as in \eqref{eq:signal-sparsity} and \eqref{eq:signal-size}, with signal sizes assumed equal.
We estimate the support set $S$ with using Bonferroni's procedure, where the nominal FWER level for Bonferroni's procedures are set at $1/(5{\log{p}})$, in line with the assumptions in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squared-exact-boundary}.
Experiments were repeated 1000 times at each of the 400 sparsity-and-signal-size combinations, for dimensions $p=10^2, 10^3$, and $10^4$.

The empirical probabilities of exact support recovery under Bonferroni's procedure are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared}.
The numerical results suggest not only good accuracy of the predicted boundaries in high-dimensions ($p=10^4$, right panels of Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared}), but also practical relevance even at moderate dimensions ($p=100$, left panels of Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared}).

We conduct further experiments to examine the optimality claims in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squared-exact-boundary} by comparing with the oracle procedure with thresholds $t_p=\min_{i\in S}x(i)$.
We also examine the claims in Remark \ref{rmk:strong-classification-boundary-1}, and compare the one-sided alternatives in Gaussian additive models with the two-sided alternatives (or equivalently, the chi-square model with $\nu=1$).
We apply both Bonferroni's procedure and the oracle thresholding procedure in both settings.

Experiments were repeated 1000 times for signal sizes ranging from $r=0$ to $6$, and for dimensions $10^2, 10^3$, and $10^5$.
Results of the experiments, shown in Figure \ref{fig:one-vs-two-sided-exact_support_recovery}, suggest vanishing difference between difficulties of two-sided vs one-sided alternatives in the additive error models, as well as vanishing difference between the powers of Bonferroni's procedures and the oracle procedures.

\subsection{The approximate, and approximate-exact support recovery problem}

Similar experiments are conducted to examine the optimality claims in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squared-approx-boundary}, and in Remark \ref{rmk:weak-classification-boundary}.
The oracle procedure for approximate support recovery is defined to be the thresholding procedure with threshold
$$
t_p(x, S) \in \argmin_{t\in\R} \frac{|\widehat{S}(t)\setminus S|}{\max\{|\widehat{S}(t)|,1\}} + \frac{|S\setminus \widehat{S}(t)|}{\max\{|{S}|,1\}},
%\mathcal{R^\mathrm{oracle}} \in \argmin_{\widehat{S}(\mathcal{R})\in\mathcal{S}} \mathrm{risk}^{\mathrm{A}}(\mathcal{R}),
$$
where $\widehat{S}(t) = \{i\;|\;x(i)\ge t\}$;
in implementation, we need only scan the values of observations $t\in\{x(1), \ldots, x(p)\}$. 
The nominal FDR level for the BH procedure is set at $1/(5{\log{p}})$, satisfying the assumptions in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squared-approx-boundary}; all other parameters are identical to that in the experiments for exact support recovery.
Results of the experiments are shown in Figure \ref{fig:one-vs-two-sided-approx_support_recovery} and Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared-approx-boundary}.

We also examine the boundary described in Theorem \ref{thm:chi-squared-exact-approx-boundary}.
All experimental settings are identical to that in the experiments for approximate support recovery.
Results of the experiments are shown in Figure \ref{fig:phase-simulated-chi-squared-approx-exact-boundary}.
% Results for the BH procedure are in general close to that of the oracle procedure, 
We also compare the performance of the BH procedure with an oracle procedure with threshold
$$
t_p(x, S) \in \min_{i\in S} x(i).
$$
In experiments, we noticed that the BH procedure sets its threshold somewhat higher than the oracle, especially for small $\beta$'s. 
The phase transition for the oracle procedure (excluded in the interest of space) follows much more closely the predicted boundary \eqref{eq:approx-exact-boundary-chisquared}.
